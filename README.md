Welcome to my Keeper-app! It is a poor copy of [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/u/0/).
It also is not currently connected to a backend, so any changes/lists you add will delete upon refresh.

This is a react app. Therefore react must be installed in order to run it.

Alternatively, you can [here](https://limitless-ravine-74485.herokuapp.com/) to see it live.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
